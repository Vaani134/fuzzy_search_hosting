modules/fuzzy_search.py
-----------------------
Core fuzzy search engine with:
  - 3-algorithm blend (token_set_ratio, WRatio, partial_ratio)
  - Synonym normalisation before scoring
  - Score boosting (exact match, startswith, substring)
  - Relevance-first composite ranking
  - In-memory product index rebuilt from SQLite
  - Optional background auto-rebuild thread

Algorithms & weights
--------------------
  token_set_ratio  0.5  — word order irrelevant, partial overlap
  WRatio           0.3  — typo tolerance
  partial_ratio    0.2  — short query inside long string

Boosting rules (applied on top of blend score, capped at 100)
--------------------------------------------------------------
  Exact match (normalised)   → +20
  Starts-with match          → +10
  Substring match (raw name) → +10

Composite ranking formula — relevance-first
-------------------------------------------
  Fuzzy threshold gate: products with fuzzy_score < 70 are excluded entirely.

  Tie band (fuzzy gap ≤ 10 points):
    final = 0.85 × fuzzy + 0.10 × popularity + 0.05 × click_rate

  Clear winner (fuzzy gap > 10 points):
    final = fuzzy   (popularity and clicks ignored)

  This ensures:
  • Irrelevant products never appear regardless of popularity
  • Clearly more relevant products always rank above less relevant ones
  • Popularity/clicks only break ties between equally relevant products

    Build a single compiled regex alternation from the synonym keys.

    Why one combined pattern instead of a loop?
    --------------------------------------------
    A loop applies replacements sequentially, so a later synonym can
    accidentally match text that was just written by an earlier one.
    Example with a loop:
        "sheesha" → "hookah"          (first replacement)
        "hooka"   matches in "hookah" → "hookaah"  (second replacement, wrong!)

    A single alternation pattern is applied in ONE scan of the string.
    The regex engine advances past each match without revisiting it, so
    no replacement can ever be re-processed.

    Construction rules:
      1. Sort keys by descending length so longer phrases (e.g. "e cig")
         are tried before shorter ones (e.g. "ecig") at each position.
      2. Wrap each key with \\b word boundaries to block partial matches
         ("pip" must not fire inside "pipe").
      3. Compile with re.IGNORECASE so the match is case-insensitive while
         the replacement is always the canonical lowercase form.

    Expand known synonym variants in *query* to their canonical forms.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    Uses a single pre-compiled regex alternation so the entire string is
    scanned exactly once.  Each matched token is replaced via a lookup
    callback; unmatched text is passed through unchanged.

    The regex and lookup dict are loaded from the `synonyms` SQLite table
    at startup and can be hot-reloaded via reload_synonyms() without
    restarting the server.

    Properties guaranteed by this implementation:
      • Word-boundary safety  — "pip" never fires inside "pipe"
      • No double replacement — "sheesha" → "hookah", not "hookaah"
      • Longest-match first   — "e cig" wins over "ecig" at the same position
      • Case-insensitive      — "Sheesha", "SHEESHA", "sheesha" all expand
      • Original spacing kept — only the matched token is replaced

    Parameters
    ----------
    query : str
        Raw user input, any casing.

    Returns

    """
    Return a "Did You Mean" spelling correction for *query*, or ``None``.

    Design goals
    ------------
    • Suggest when helpful  — obvious typos like "grdiner" → "grinder"
    • Stay silent otherwise — correct queries, gibberish, or empty input
    • Independent of search results — does not rely on top_result_score
      (that parameter is accepted for backwards-compatibility but ignored)

    Candidate pool (three sources, merged and deduplicated)
    -------------------------------------------------------
    1. ``choices``          — caller-supplied strings (top product names,
                              category names, etc.)
    2. ``SYNONYMS`` keys    — known misspelling variants ("hooka", "grider"…)
    3. ``SYNONYMS`` values  — canonical forms ("hookah", "grinder"…)
    4. ``_SUGGESTION_KEYWORDS`` — curated product-type vocabulary

    Combining synonym keys AND values is important: a user typing "grdiner"
    needs to match against "grinder" (a value), while a user typing "hooka"
    needs to match against "hookah" (also a value, since "hooka" → "hookah").

    Threshold logic  (score = WRatio on normalized strings)
    --------------------------------------------------------
    score < 50   → too distant — no reliable correction exists → None
    50 ≤ score < 100 → plausible typo — return the best candidate
    score = 100  → identical after normalization — nothing to correct → None

    Why 100 instead of 90 as the upper bound?
    ------------------------------------------
    "hooka" scores 90.9 against "hookah" — that IS a typo that needs
    correcting.  Cutting off at 90 would suppress it.  The only case where
    we must return None is when the normalized query IS the candidate
    (score = 100), which the identity check below handles explicitly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    query            : str
        Raw user input, any casing.
    choices          : list of str, optional
        Extra candidates (e.g. top product names from the search results).

    """
    Combine three normalised signals (each 0–100) into a single ranking score.

    Relevance-first design
    ----------------------
    Popularity and click signals are only applied when the fuzzy score is
    within FUZZY_TIE_BAND (10 points) of the best fuzzy score in the result
    set.  When a product's fuzzy score is clearly lower than the best match,
    it ranks on fuzzy alone — popularity cannot rescue an irrelevant result.

    Formula (tie band — fuzzy scores are close)
    -------------------------------------------
    final = 0.85 × fuzzy + 0.10 × popularity + 0.05 × click_rate

    Formula (clear winner — fuzzy gap > FUZZY_TIE_BAND)
    ----------------------------------------------------
    final = fuzzy   (popularity and click signals ignored)

    Weight rationale
    ----------------
    0.85  fuzzy_score  — relevance is the dominant signal.  Raised from 0.7
                         to ensure a clearly more relevant product always wins.
    0.10  popularity   — secondary tie-breaker.  Reduced from 0.2 so it cannot
                         override a 10-point fuzzy advantage.
    0.05  click_rate   — tertiary tie-breaker.  Reduced from 0.1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fuzzy                  : boosted fuzzy blend score for this product (0–100)
    popularity             : normalised sales-volume score (0–100)
    click_rate             : normalised click-count score (0–100)
    best_fuzzy_in_results  : highest fuzzy score across all candidates in this
                             search.  Used to determine whether this product is
                             in the tie band or clearly behind.

        Before scoring, the query is checked against QUERY_EXPANSIONS.
        If a match is found, additional search terms are generated and each
        is searched independently.  Results from all terms are merged by
        product ID — each product appears at most once, keeping its best
        score across all expansion terms.

        Example: "smoking stuff" → searches ["smoking stuff", "hookah",
        "pipe", "cigarette", "tobacco", "cigar"] and merges all results.

        The original query is always searched first.  Expansion terms are
        additive — they can only add results, never remove them.

        Filters applied BEFORE fuzzy scoring (on the in-memory index):
